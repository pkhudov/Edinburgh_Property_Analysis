### _Question_: 

- How well can the features of the property be used to predict the price of the property?
- Are particular areas or neighbourhoods more sought after or expensive than others?



# Data Analysis Plan

1. Clean the data
2. For the first question, perform PCA to select the most important features
3. Produce initial visualizations
   1. Graphs for quantities: property type, room type, distr for accomodates
   2. Graphs for price: number of bedrooms, number of beds, occupancy 
   3. Graphs for price/person: property type. 
   4. Graphs for reviews, price/person

What predicts more the price? 


# Limitations:
no distance between locations


Strengths: price/person
---
Produce multivarible regression and single variable regression using one pca. See which one is better. 

Outliers: people put very high prices
